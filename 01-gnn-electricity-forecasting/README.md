## Overview

This research project develops state-of-the-art electricity price forecasting models using Graph Neural Networks to capture complex interdependencies between different market zones, generation sources, and transmission constraints. The model aims to improve upon traditional time-series forecasting by explicitly modeling the graph structure of electricity markets.

## Research Objectives

- **Primary**: Develop GNN-based forecasting models that outperform traditional time-series methods
- **Secondary**: Create interpretable models that can explain price formation mechanisms
- **Tertiary**: Enable real-time forecasting for intraday and day-ahead markets
- **Impact**: Provide 15-20% improvement in forecasting accuracy over baseline models

## Technical Approach

### Model Architecture
- **Graph Construction**: Market zones as nodes, transmission lines as edges
- **Node Features**: Historical prices, demand, generation mix, weather
- **Edge Features**: Transmission capacity, flow constraints, congestion
- **Temporal Modeling**: LSTM/GRU layers for time-series dependencies
- **Spatial Modeling**: GraphSAGE/GAT for spatial dependencies

### Implementation Framework
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch Geometric for GNN implementation
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Matplotlib for result visualization
- **Deployment**: MLflow for model tracking and deployment
